Hello World

Welcome to my site!

<!-- image of a duck -->

I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the 
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...

HTML is cool
CSS is cooler
JS is the best

What do you need to create a website?

Not much!
A computer (always a good start)
A text editor (I am using atom)
A web browser (I am using chrome)
Some HTML, CSS and JS files

Follow my progress on github
